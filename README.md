# Birdwatching

## Purpose

This is a DIY license plate scanner that we hope marginalized communities can make use of to warn them when bad actors (police, ICE, etc.) are entering their neighborhoods. This will give them the chance to react accordingly. The project is open source and we will be making the entire project as user friendly and transparent as possible.
